# Invoices 

![Organizer settings page, on the reusable media tab, showing a checkbox for allowing updating existing invoices and a note recommending to keep this turned off for most jurisdications](../../assets/screens/organizer/invoices.png) 

On the "Invoices" tab, you can choose whether you want to "Allow to update existing invoices". By default, invoices are immutable once they have been issued. For most jurisdictions, we recommend leaving this option turned off and always issuing a new invoice if a change needs to be made. Please seek legal advice regarding this issue before you check the "Allow to update existing invoices" box.
