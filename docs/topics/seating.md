## Prerequisits

Seating plans can be created and edited globally in your organizer profile. Open your organizer profile and then click "Seating plans" at the bottom of the navigation menu on the left. However, in order to use Seating plans for your event, the Seating plugin has to be enabled for that specific event. Browse to your event -> Settings -> Plugins. In the Features tab, enable the plugin "Seating".
