# Vouchers

Vouchers are codes generated by pretix that can be redeemed for certain products in your shop. 
pretix allows you to automatically generate these codes and send them out via email. 
Vouchers have several useful applications. 
With vouchers, you can: 

 - make products available at a reduced price for voucher holders
 - make a product only available for a select group of people such as speakers at a conference or VIPs
 - reserve a certain quantity of a product quota for voucher holders
 - make sure that voucher holders still get access to a product even if it is sold out
 - make products only visible to voucher holders in your shop

Vouchers are not to be confused with [gift cards](gift-cards.md), which essentially function like an additional method of payment for your customers.
