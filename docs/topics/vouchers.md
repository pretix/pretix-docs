# Vouchers

Vouchers are codes generated by pretix that can be redeemed for certain products in your shop. 
pretix allows you to automatically generate these codes and send them out via email. 
Vouchers have several useful applications. 
With vouchers, you can: 

 - make products available at a reduced price for voucher holders
 - make a product only available for a select group of people such as speakers at a conference or invited guests
 - reserve a certain quantity of a product quota for voucher holders
 - make sure that voucher holders still get access to a product even if it is sold out
 - make products only visible to voucher holders in your shop

Vouchers are not to be confused with [gift cards](gift-cards.md), which essentially function like an additional method of payment for your customers. 

## Prerequisites

Vouchers are handled on the event level, so you need to create an event first. 
Your account needs to be activated before you can send out vouchers via email. 
This is a measure to prevent against abuse of the system by spammers. 
See the tutorial's section on [account activation](../tutorial/organizer-account.md#activation) for further information. 

## How To 

 - voucher codes must be at least 5 characters long

The settings for vouchers are located at [Your Event] â†’ "Vouchers". 
This page gives you an overview of all vouchers that have already been created and options to search and filter vouchers. 
As described in the introduction, vouchers have several useful applications. 
Those applications will be explained in the following subsections. 

### Exclusive product availability

This subsection explains how to make a product only available for a select group of people such as speakers at a conference or invited guests. 
First, create an admission product. 
Open the "Availability" tab and check the box next to "This product can only be bought using a voucher".
