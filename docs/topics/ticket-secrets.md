# Ticket secrets 

Every individual admission product generated by pretix has a ticket secret. 
This ticket secret can be represented as a QR code or as a barcode. 
By default, it consists of 32 lower case letters and is generated randomly. 

This article tells you about pretix' default method for ticket secret generation in detail. 
It also tells you how to change that behavior if necessary. 

## Prerequisites

Ticket secrets are handled on the event level, so you have to create an event first. 

## How To 

Every product sold via pretix has a ticket secret. 
This ticket secret is a code that can be represented as a sequence of characters, a QR code, or a barcode.
By default, this code consists of 32 lower case characters and numbers. 
The characters `o`, `O`, `1`, `i`, and `l` are **not** used to avoid confusion. 

If you want to change the length of the ticket secret code, navigate to :navpath:Your event: → :fa3-wrench: Settings → Tickets:.
Under "Length of ticket codes", choose a number between 12 and 64. 

The approach with random ticket secrets has several advantages: 

 - Codes are short and easy to scan or type. 
 - Guessing or forging a valid ticket code is impossible. 
 - The code remains the same even if the product itself changes due to rebooking. 

Random ticket secrets can only be validated by checking them against the database. 
The device running pretixSCAN needs access to a database containing all ticket secrets that have been generated for the current event. 
The default behavior of pretixSCAN is that it downloads the entire database onto the device itself. 
This makes it possible to fall back to offline mode when the connection between the scanning device and the server is unreliable or unavailable. 

There are a few situation in which this can lead to problems: 

 - If the number of valid tickets for a single event exceeds 25,000, downloading the entire database onto the scanning device may be too resource-heavy and time-consuming. 
 - If losing sensible data contained in the ticket database along with one of the scanning devices is unacceptable. 
 - If the scanners operate in offline mode regularly and tickets have to be valid instantly after purchase (and a delay of a few minutes is unacceptable)

If one or more conditions apply to the event you are organizing, you may want to switch to the pretix signature scheme for ticket secret generation instead. 
The next section tells you how it works.

If you want to switch to the signature scheme, navigate to :navpath:Your event: → :fa3-wrench: Settings → Tickets:.
Under "Ticket code generator", select "pretix signature scheme 1".
