# Ticket secrets 

Every individual admission product generated by pretix has a ticket secret. 
This ticket secret can be represented as a QR code or as a barcode. 
By default, it consists of 32 lower case letters and is generated randomly. 

This article tells you about pretix' default method for ticket secret generation in detail. 
It also tells you how to change that behavior if necessary. 

## Prerequisites

Ticket secrets are handled on the event level, so you have to create an event first. 

## How To 

Every product sold via pretix has a ticket secret. 
This ticket secret is a code that can be represented as a sequence of characters, a QR code, or a barcode.
By default, this code consists of 32 lower case characters and numbers. 
The characters `o`, `O`, `1`, `i`, and `l` are **not** used to avoid confusion. 

The approach with random ticket secrets has several advantages: 

 - Codes are short and easy to scan or type. 
 - Guessing or forging a valid ticket code is impossible. 
 - The code remains the same even if the product itself changes due to rebooking. 

The main disadvantage to this approach is that random ticket secrets can only be validated by comparison to the database. 
The device running pretixSCAN needs access to a database containing all ticket secrets that have been generated for the current event.
