# How to set restrictions on product availability 

This article tells you how to make products only available within a certain time period. 
By default, tickets will be available for purchase from the moment your ticket shop goes live until the end of your event. 
This article will show you two methods for changing that: 
 1. restricting the availability of all products in your shop via the "timeline" tab in the general event settings
 2. restricting the availability of individual products via the "availability" tab in the settings for the product in question 

## Prerequisites

What conditions have to be met for this information to be applicable? Which settings have to be adjusted, which plugins have to be activated, which previous knowledge is assumed by the article? 

## How To

If you want to restrict availability of all products in your shop to a certain time period, you can do that by switching to the "timeline" tab. 
With the options available here, you can set a start and end date and time for the sale of tickets and other products in your shop. 
If you set a start of presale, no products will be able to be sold before that date and time. 
If you send an end of presale, no products will be able to be sold before that date and time. 
If you have enabled box office sales (pretixPOS) during event creation or on the "basics" tab of the general settings, you will still be able to sell products via pretixPOS outside the presale period you set here. 
This page also lets you set restrictions on when and how your customers can make modifications to the details of their orders. 
The restrictions you set up on the "timeline" tab apply to all products in your shop. 

You can also restrict availability for individual products by navigating to :navpath:Your event → Products → Products:, clicking the product in question, and switching to the "availability" tab.
