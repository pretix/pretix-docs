# Gift Cards

Not to be confused with vouchers.

The gift cards tab lets you make organizer-level settings for gift cards. You can choose how many years gift cards are valid for. This field is empty by default, meaning gift cards will be valid in your shop indefinitely. You can also choose how long the gift card codes are. The default is 12 digits and you can leave this as it is unless you have a specific reason.
