# Title

When creating a new event, you can either create a singular event, or you can create an event series. 
This article explains the difference between a singular event and an event series, helps you decide which one to choose, and tells you how to set up an event series. 

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have access to an organizer account, either because you created it yourself when you signed up on pretix.eu, or because you were invited and granted access by a co-organizer. 

## How To 

### When does it make sense to create an event series? 

The individual dates of an event series will always share the same settings. 
Only the following aspects can be different for each individual date: 

 - date and time 
 - location
 - text on the shop page 
 - product quotas 
 - check-in rules 
 
We recommend creating an event series for the following use cases: 

 - a theater performing the same play on several nights 
 - a touring act playing the same concert in several different locations on different dates 
 - a workshop hosted in several different locations
 
We **do not** recommend creating an event series for the following use cases: 

 - events with large gaps of time between the individual dates, such as annual conferences. 
 Many parameters can change over the course of a year and attendees will typically only buy a ticket for the upcoming date. 
 - events that take place over the course of several days, such as conferences or festivals.
