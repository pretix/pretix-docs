# Public profile/Organizer page

This article introduces you to the public profile of your organizer in pretix and shows you how to customize it via the "Organizer page" tab in the organizer settings. Possible customizations include a header image, website text, the default overview style for upcoming events, and links for the page footer. 

## Prerequisits

This article assumes that you access to an organizer account, either because you created it yourself when you signed up on pretix.eu, or because you were invited to become part of a pretix team by a co-organizer. 

If you want to use a header image on your public profile, please prepare an image that meets the following criteria: 
 - shows your company name/logo 
 - .png or .jpg format 
 - resolution of 1140 √ó 120 pixels or smaller 
 - (alternatively: an image with a width of 1170 pixels or more)
 - no small details that may get lost when the image is rendered on small phone screens 

We recommend that you make a final choice as to which languages the public profile will be made available in. Go to the "Localization" tab and choose your languages from the list before adding text or links on the "Organizer page" tab. 

## How To

Switching to the "Organizer page" tab at the top allows you to set customizations for your organizer page. The organizer page is the public profile of your organizer. You can take a look at it by clicking the :btnüëÅ Public profile: button in the bar at the top.

The "Public profile" button in the top bar is highlighted.](../../assets/screens/organizer/organizer-page-public-profile.png) 

By default, the organizer name will be displayed in the page header of your public profile. The organizer page settings allow you to replace the name with an image. The image should include your logo. It should be a .png or .jpg file with a resolution of 1140 √ó 120 pixels or smaller. If you want to use a larger header image on your public profile, you should check the "Use header image in its full size" box. This option works best with images of 1170 or more pixels in width. In any case, we recommend not using an image with small details, since it will be resized for smaller screens. You can add the header image by clicking the :btn:Browse...: button next to the "Header image" option and choosing the image file to upload from your computer. You are also given the option to use this header image on pages for events that do not have their own individually uploaded logo. 

In the "Homepage text" fields, you can provide text to be displayed on your public profile. You will have one field for each language you activate in the "Localization" tab (see the next segment of this article). If you have more than one language enabled, your public profile will allow the viewer to switch between those languages via the links in the top right corner. 

You can choose the "Default overview style" for events on your public profile from the drop-down menu. Events will either be displayed in a list, a weekly overview, or a monthly overview. The list overview style is only available if your event series has 50 or less dates in the future.
