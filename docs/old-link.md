# Unfortunately, this page no longer exists.

You followed a link to our old documentation page.
We have recently reworked our documentation and moved to a new structure.
While for most pages from the old documentation, there is an equivalent page in the new documentation, you have clicked a link to one of the few where that is not the case.
We'd like to apologize for any inconvenience this causes.

If you are using pretix for the first time, the best entry point into our new documentation is our [tutorial](tutorial/getting-started.md).

If you are looking for in-depth information on the features of pretix and how to use them, refer to the [guides](guides/index.md) pages.

You can also enter a keyword in the search field at the top of the page. 

If your question is not answered, please feel free to reach out to us through our support channels.
