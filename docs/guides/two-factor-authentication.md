# Two-factor authentication 

The term "Two-factor authentication" or "2FA" refers to using two factors to authenticate your identity. 
This provides more security than authenticating with a single factor such as a password. 
pretix supports (2FA) for your user account. 

The first factor is always your password. 
The second factor can either be a WebAuthn-compatible hardware token or an authenticator application. 
This article explains the advantages of 2FA and how to set it up for your pretix user account. 

## Prerequisites

Depending on the authentication method you intend to use, you need to have either a WebAuthn-compatible hardware token (such as a Yubikey) or an authenticator app (such as Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, or Bitwarden). 

## How to

Log in to your pretix user account. 
Click the :btn-icon:fa3-user: [Your name]: button in the top right corner. 
This takes you to your user account settings. 
Take a look at the "Two-factor authentication" setting. 
If 2FA is disabled, then there is a gray "Disabled" tag next to it. 
In order to enable 2FA, click :btn:Enable:.
