# Meta documentation 

This section of the documentation explains how the documentation itself works, how it was written, and how to contribute to it. 
This is directed at both coworkers, and at external contributors. 
It also serves as a reminder for the people writing the docs themselves how we do certain things, and why we decided to do them that way.
