# pretixSCAN 

pretixSCAN is a powerful application that helps you handle the check-in at your events. 
pretixSCAN is available for Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows. 
The primary function of pretixSCAN is to validate tickets, but it also offers many other features, such as:

 - searching for participants manually if they do not have their ticket on hand
 - printing attendee badges
 - quickly viewing attendance statistics

pretixSCAN is not to be confused with our other apps: pretixPRINT, which takes care of the printing of tickets, badges and receipts for you; [pretixPOS](../pretixpos/index.md), which handles product sales; or pretixLEAD, which facilitates lead acquisition at your events.

For information on the **Android** version of pretixSCAN, see [pretixSCAN (Android app)](android.md).
