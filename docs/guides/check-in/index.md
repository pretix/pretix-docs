# Check-In 

The articles in this section explain how to use the tools that pretix offers you to set up the check-in at your event according to your requirements. 

**Check-in lists** keep track of who attends your event. 
You need one check-in list for every entrance with a separate function at your event. 
See the article on [check-in lists](check-in-lists.md) to learn more. 

You can use **custom check-in rules** to place restrictions on the validity of tickets based on time, number of previous entries, ticket type, gate, and other conditions. 
See the article on [Custom check-in rules](custom.md) to learn more.
