# Check-In Lists 

This article tells you how to create, configure, and use check-in lists. 
Check-in lists keep track of who attends your event. 
Generally speaking, you need one check-in list for every separate entrance at your event. 
If there is one venue with multiple entrances, then one shared check-in list is enough. 
If you have separate entrances for separate products, such as fast lane access or VIP tickets, then you will need one check-in list for every entrance. 

Check-in lists are completely independent from one another. 
A ticket is valid once on every list on which it is included. 
If you are hosting subevents with more exclusive attendance, then each of those subevents will need its own check-in list. 

We recommend using dedicated devices with the pretixSCAN app for your check-in. 
You can also do a manual check-in through the the backend, or you can print your lists and check people in with a pen and paper.
