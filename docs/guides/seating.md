# Seating

If you are selling tickets for a stadium, a theater, or a similar venue, then you probably want to sell tickets for individual seats. 
The seating feature of pretix allows you to do just that. 
You can design a seating plan of your venue and use it for your events. 
Customers will be able to look at the seating plan and choose their preferred seat. 
This article tells you how to do that. 

## Prerequisites

Many aspects of seating are handled on the event level, so you need to create an event first. 

## How to

 - Enabling the plugin 
 - Creating a seating plan 
 - Creating products for seating

### Enabling the plugin

In order to enable the "Seating" plugin for your event, navigate to :navpath:Your event → :fa3-wrench: Settings → Plugins: and open the :btn:Features: tab. 
The Seating plugin is included as a "Top recommendation" at the top of the page. 
Click the :btn:Enable: button next to it. 
Now that you have enabled the seating plugin, all settings associated with seating are available for your event. 

### Creating a seating plan

Seating plans are handled on the organizer level. 
This allows you to create a seating plan and use it for multiple events hosted by the same organizer. 

In order to create a new seating plan, navigate to :navpath:Your organizer → :i-seat: Seating plans: and click the :btn-icon:fa3-plus: Create a new seating plan: button. 
On the next page, click the :btn-icon:fa3-external-link: Go to editor: button. 
This takes you to the seating plan editor at https://seats.pretix.eu/.
