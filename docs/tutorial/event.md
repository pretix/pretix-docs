# Event 

After setting up your organizer account, the next step is creating an event. In order to create an event, you must be logged in to your [https://pretix.eu/control/](pretix.eu) account. Click the :btn:pretix.eu: button in the top left corner of the website. This takes you to the dashboard, which includes an overview of your upcoming events. Click the :btn:⊕ Create a new event: button. 

In the first step of event creation, you are asked three basic questions. First, choose the appropriate organizer account for the event–most likely the one you just set up in the previous step of this tutorial. Second, choose the event type. You have two options: "Singular event or non-event shop" and "Event series or time slot booking". Since you're setting up a conference, the first option is right for you. Creating an event series only makes sense if you're planning on repeating the same conference several times or if you're planning for your customers to participate in a series of conferences that they buy tickets for in a single purchase. 






One event corresponds to one online shop that your customers will be able to visit and make purchases in. You'll have to make a few decisions while creating your event. 

 - __Organizer:__ Select the organizer account for this event. Since this is the first time you're using pretix, simply select the organizer account you created in the previous step. 

 - __Event type:__ Choose whether you want to create a singular event or a series of events. 


? What exactly are the differences between singular events and series? 

? Can you copy info from one event series to a new one?

Conferences, workshops, trade fairs, one-off concerts, sale of digital content, multi-day events with combination tickets. 

? the difference between the person who placed the order and the person who the ticket is for (name on the invoice vs. name on the ticket)
