# Event 

After setting up your organizer account, the next step is creating an event. In order to create an event, you must be logged in to your [https://pretix.eu/control/](pretix.eu) account. Click the :btn:pretix.eu: button in the top left corner of the website. This takes you to the dashboard, which includes an overview of your upcoming events. Click the :btn:⊕ Create a new event: button.

In the first step of event creation, you choose the organizer account that is hosting this event–most likely the one you just set up in the previous step of this tutorial. This selection cannot be changed after the event has been created, so make sure that you pick the right organizer account here. 

Next, choose the event type. You have two options: "Singular event or non-event shop" and "Event series or time slot booking". Creating an event series only makes sense if you're planning on hosting the same conference several times or if you're planning for your customers to participate in a series of conferences that they buy tickets for in a single purchase. Creating a singular event is the appropriate choice for most use cases, so we recommend you choose that option. 

After that, choose which languages to use for the event. By default, the languages you chose while setting up the organizer account should already be checked here. Simply activate and deactivate the languages as needed.

!!! Note 

    pretix offers many settings and customizations where you input your own text, for example, the description on the organizer page, the name of your events, and so on. You will need to provide a translation in every language you choose here for each individual item. This can amount to a lot of work. We recommend using no more than two or three languages at a time unless you are working with dedicated translators. 

Once you are happy with your choices, click :btn:Continue: at the bottom right of the page.

In the second step of event creation, you are asked to provide a name and a short form for the event. Let's say you're organizing a conference on xylology in the year 2027. In that case, your "event name" could be "International Xylology Conference 2027" and your short form could be "ixc27". The short form will be appended to your organizer's URL, resulting in an URL such as [https://pretix.eu/isx/ixc27], where "isx" is the name of your organizer account you chose during account creation and ixc27 is the name of the event you're choosing right now. 

!!! Note

    The short form may only contain letters, numbers, dots and dashes. __It may not contain spaces.__ It may not contain special characters. Spaces and special characters would render the URL invalid. 

You also have to pick a start time and a currency for your event. All other fields on this page are optional and can be filled out later.

You will probably still need to change some settings manually, e.g. date and time settings and texts that contain the event name' and the option to import settings from a previously created event.](../../assets/screens/event/create-event3.png "Create new event step 3 screenshot" ) 

In the third step of event creation, you are asked if you want to copy information from a previously created event. This step can save you a lot of work from your second event onwards. But since this is the first event you're organizing using pretix, simply leave the default (_"Do not copy"_) and click :btn:Continue:

You just created an event!", showing options for creating ticket types and enabling a few basic features for the event.Not pictured: setting up payment options and providing contact information.](../../assets/screens/event/create-event3.png "Create new event step 3 screenshot" ) 

The next page congratulates you on creating your first event using pretix and gives you a quick overview for products and basic settings for the event. We will take a closer look at products (tickets, gift cards, etc.) in the next section of this tutorial.
