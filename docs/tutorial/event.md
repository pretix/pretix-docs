# Event 

After creating an organizer account, the next step is creating an event. One event corresponds to one online shop that your customers will be able to visit and make purchases in. You'll have to make a few decisions while creating your event. 

 - __Organizer:__ Select the organizer account for this event. Since this is the first time you're using pretix, simply select the organizer account you created in the previous step. 

 - __Event type:__ Choose whether you want to create a singular event or a series of events. 


? What exactly are the differences between singular events and series? 

? Can you copy info from one event series to a new one?

Conferences, workshops, trade fairs, one-off concerts, sale of digital content, multi-day events with combination tickets. 

? the difference between the person who placed the order and the person who the ticket is for (name on the invoice vs. name on the ticket)
