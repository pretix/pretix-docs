# Getting Started

Welcome to the pretix tutorial. This is your step-by-step guide to hosting your very first event using pretix.

Before you can do anything with pretix, you have to create an account. Don't worry: creating an account is __completely free__ of charge and puts you under no obligation to give us any money. You are free to play around with our software to your heart's content before you decide whether pretix is the right choice for you. 

!!! Note

    If your company, association or institution already has an organizer account, please do not create a new account. Instead, ask your co-organizers to send you an invitation and add you to the team.

To create an account, open the website [pretix.eu](https://pretix.eu/about/en/ "https://pretix.eu/about/en/"). Click the green :btn:Create your first ticket shop: button. This takes you to a new website which asks you to enter the info for your pretix account in the left column, and the name and short form for your organization in the right column.

For your personal account, provide your name, email address, and a secure password. Enter __your own__ name into the field on the top left. Ideally, choose a name by which your co-organizers will recognize you and which our support team can use to address you. Your first name and last name should work perfectly fine. 

!!! Warning

    The short form is the unique identifier for your company in our website's backend and will also be used in the shop URL. Please put some careful consideration into the short form and choose it you're absolutely positive that you're happy with it. 
    
    The short form cannot be changed without you contacting customer support and our team putting a significant amount of work into it. 

The name of the company, association or institution that you want to organize events for goes in the field on the top right. Below that, please enter a short form of the organization's name. This short form will be used for the URL where your events can be found. Let's say, for example, that you're working for a cooperative named Awesome Event Corporation. In this case, you will enter "Awesome Event Corporation" into the company name field, and "awesome-corp" into the short form field. This means that all the events you create will be found at [https://pretix.eu/awesome-corp/](https://pretix.eu/awesome-corp/ "https://pretix.eu/awesome-corp/") in the future. You can also use a custom domain. Simply proceed with signup now and contact us afterwards. 

!!! Note

    The short form may only contain letters, numbers, dots and dashes. __It may not contain spaces.__ It may not contain special characters. Spaces and special characters would render the URL invalid. 


Once you have filled out the form, please also read our privacy policy and our terms of service. They are both linked on this page. Once you have read them both carefully, check the boxes to confirm. 

Click the :btn:Continue: button and your journey to hosting your first event using pretix can finally begin!
