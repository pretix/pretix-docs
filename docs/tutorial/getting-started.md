# Getting Started

Welcome to the pretix tutorial. This is your step-by-step guide to hosting your very first event with pretix.

First things first: Before you can do anything with pretix, you have to create an account. Don't worry: creating an account is completely free of charge and puts you under no obligation to ever pay us any money. You are free to play around with our software to your heart's content before you decide whether pretix is the right choice for you.

To create an account, open the website [pretix.eu](https://pretix.eu/about/en/ "https://pretix.eu/about/en/"). Click the green :btn:Create your first ticket shop: button. This takes you to a new website which asks you to put in your name, email address, and a secure password. Please enter __your own__ name into the field on the top left. Ideally, choose a name by which your co-organizers will recognize you and which our support team can use to address you. Your first name and last name should work perfectly fine.

The name of the company, association or institution that you want to create a ticket shop for goes in the field on the top right. Below that, please enter a short form of the organization's name. This short form will be used for the URL where your events can be found. Let's say, for example, that you're working for a cooperative named Incredible Events. In this case, you will enter "Incredible Events" into the "company name" field, and "incredibleevents" into the short form field. This will mean that all your events will be found at https://pretix.eu/incredibleevents/ in the future. 

Once you have filled out this form, please also read our privacy policy and our terms of service. They are linked on this page. Once you have read them both carefully, check the boxes to confirm. 

Click the :btn:Continue: and your journey to hosting your first event with pretix can finally begin!
