# Getting Started

Welcome to the pretix tutorial. 
In this tutorial, we will go through all the necessary steps for hosting our very first event using pretix.

Before we are able to do anything with pretix, we have to create an account. 
The good news is: creating an account is __completely free__ of charge and does not come with any obligation to pay money for the use of pretix in the future. 
We are free to play around with the pretix software to our heart's content before deciding whether pretix is the right choice for us. 

!!! Note

    If your company, association or institution already has an organizer account, please do not create a new account. 
    Instead, ask your co-organizers to send you an invitation and add you to the team. 

![pretix.eu, a website introducing pretix and its main features. 
There is a green button labeled 'Create your first ticket shop' on the right.](../assets/screens/account/pretix-eu.png "pretix.eu screenshot" ) 

To create an account, we are going to open the website [pretix.eu](https://pretix.eu/about/en/ "https://pretix.eu/about/en/") and click the green :btn:Create your first ticket shop: button. 
This takes us to a new website on which we will enter the info for our pretix account in the left column, and the name and short form for our organization in the right column. 

![a website with input fields for account information as well as the name and short form of the organizer](../assets/screens/account/pretix-create-account.png "pretix.eu/about/en/setup screenshot" ) 

For our personal account, we are going to provide our name, email address, and a secure password. 
The field on the top left is meant for a **personal name**, not a company name. 
We are going to choose a name by which our co-organizers will recognize us and which our support team can use to address us. 
For this tutorial, our name is going to be John Doe. 

!!! Warning

    The short form is the unique identifier for your company in our website's backend and will also be used in the shop URL. 
    Please put careful consideration into the short form and make sure you are happy with it.

    The short form cannot be changed without you contacting customer support and our team putting a significant amount of work into it. 

The name of the company, association or institution that we want to organize events for goes in the field on the top right. 
Below that, we are going to enter a short form of the organization's name. 
This short form will be used for the URL where our events can be found. 
For this tutorial, we are going to create an account for our Example Organization. 
So we will enter "Example Organization" into the company name field, and "ex-org" into the short form field. 
This means that our organizer's profile and all the events we are going to create will be found at [https://pretix.eu/ex-org/](https://pretix.eu/ex-org/) in the future. 

It is also possible to use a custom domain. 
Using a custom domain with pretix would mean simply proceed with signup now and contact the team afterwards via email (support@pretix.eu) or phone (+49 6221 32177-50)
