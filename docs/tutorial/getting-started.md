# Getting Started

Welcome to the pretix tutorial. 
In this tutorial, we will go through all the necessary steps for hosting our very first event using pretix.

Before we are able to do anything with pretix, we have to create an account. 
Good news: creating an account is __completely free__ of charge and does not come with any obligation to pay money for the use of pretix in the future. 
We are free to play around with the pretix software to our heart's content before deciding whether pretix is the right choice for us. 

!!! Note

    If your company, association or institution already has an organizer account, it is not necessary to create a new account. 
    Instead, you can ask your co-organizers to send you an invitation and add you to the team. 

![pretix.eu, a website introducing pretix and its main features. 
There is a green button labeled 'Create your first ticket shop' on the right.](../assets/screens/account/pretix-eu.png "pretix.eu screenshot" ) 

To create an account, we are going to click the green :btn:Create you first ticket shop: button on the [pretix website] (https://pretix.eu/about/en/ "https://pretix.eu/about/en").
This takes us to a site on which we will enter the info for our personal pretix account in the left column, and the name and short form for our organization in the right column. 

![a website with input fields for account information as well as the name and short form of the organizer](../assets/screens/account/pretix-create-account.png "pretix.eu/about/en/setup screenshot" ) 

For our personal account, we are going to provide our name, email address, and a secure password. 
The field on the top left is meant for the name of the person to whom the account belongs, not for a company name. 
We are going to choose a name by which our co-organizers will recognize us and which our support team can use to address us. 
For this tutorial, our name is going to be Jordan Doe. 

!!! Warning

    The short form is the unique identifier for your company in our website's backend and will also be used in the shop URL. 
    Please put careful consideration into the short form and make sure you are happy with it.

    The short form cannot be changed without you contacting customer support and our team putting a significant amount of work into it. 

The "full name" field is meant for the name of the company, association or institution for which we want to organize events. 
The "address short form" field is for a short form of the organization's name. 
This short form will be used for the URL under which our events can be found. 
For this tutorial, we are going to create an account for our Tutorial Organization. 
So we will enter "Tutorial Organization" into the full name field, and "ex-org" into the address short form field. 
This means that our organizer's profile and all the events we are going to create will be found at [https://pretix.eu/ex-org/](https://pretix.eu/ex-org/) from now on. 

There is no need to create a test account or use the word "test" anywhere in the short form or name. 
pretix offers a test mode that allows our organizer and events to remain invisible to the public, but still gives us access to all functions and settings. 
By using the official name of our organization for the account right away, we can ensure that we get to use our preferred URL. 
We can also avoid having to make the same adjustments to two different accounts. 
Our organizer account will not be visible to the public, nor will it incur any charges, until we take our first shop live.

The privacy policy and terms of service are both linked on this page. 
Reading them carefully, agreeing with them and checking the boxes to confirm is a requirement for using pretix. 

We will now click the :btn:Continue: button and thus take our first step towards hosting our first event using pretix.
