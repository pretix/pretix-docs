# Products

A product is anything that you sell via pretix. A ticket is a product. A gift card is a product. A meal pass is a product. A conference t-shirt is a product. You will be selling a variety of products in your shop. Some of those products will be admission tickets. Some of them will be additional products. This article will guide you through the process of creating products and making them available in your shop. The result will look similar to the [pretix demo conference](https://pretix.eu/demoshops/democon/). 

## Editing products 

Navigate to [Your event] → "Products" → "Products". Two products have already been created automatically during event creation. The website should show you two tickets: "regular ticket" and "reduced ticket". We will first edit the "regular ticket" so that we can base all other tickets on this one. Click the "regular ticket". This takes you to the "modify product" dialog. Change the English item name to "Standard Ticket" and to an appropriate translation in any other languages you have activated. The English description we use in the demo shop is the following: 

"This is a simple ticket where workshops can be booked as additional products. Additional products can be set up so that they can also be rebooked later. It also includes the medium care package as a bundle." 

Feel free to copy the text into the English "description" field and add an appropriate translation if applicable. You may also add a .png or .jpg file via the "product picture" button to further distinguish this products from the others in the final shop. 

Next, click on the "price" tab. Change the "default price" field to your desired value. In our demo shop, that price is 250.00 €. Select the appropriate tax rate from the "sales tax" dropdown.
