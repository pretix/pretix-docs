# Products

A product is anything that you sell via pretix. A ticket is a product. A gift card is a product. A meal pass is a product. A conference t-shirt is a product. You will be selling a variety of products in your shop. Some of those products will be admission tickets. Some of them will be additional products. This article will guide you through the process of creating products and making them available in your shop.
