## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Cyprus, VAT ("Φόρος Προστιθέμενης Αξίας", "ΦΠΑ") may apply.
You can configure all Cypriot VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Cyprus currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Cyprus](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Cyprus).

## pretixPOS

When operating a cash register in Cyprus, the cash register must be certified according to [local legislation](https://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/ems/ems.nsf/All/A9EA69CCF2A643A64325795E002770CE?OpenDocument).
pretixPOS is **not** certified and can therefore **not** be used as cash register software in Cyprus.
