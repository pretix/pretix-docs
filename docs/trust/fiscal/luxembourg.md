## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Luxembourg, VAT ("Taxe sur la valeur ajout√©e", "TVA") may apply.
You can configure all Luxembourgish VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Luxembourg currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format for transactions between businesses (B2B) or businesses and consumers (B2C).

Luxembourg only mandates e-invoices for transactions between businesses and the government (B2G) using the PEPPOL network.
pretix is planning to provide a PEPPOL integration.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Luxembourg](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Luxembourg).

## pretixPOS

We are not aware of specific requirements on cash registers in Luxembourg.
Therefore, we believe pretixPOS can generally be used in Luxembourg.
