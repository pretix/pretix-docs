## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Slovakia, VAT ("Da≈à z pridanej hodnoty", "DPH") may apply.
You can configure all Slovakian VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Slovakia is planning to introduce mandatory e-invoicing for transactions between businesses (B2B) in 2027.
The [proposed law](https://www.slov-lex.sk/elegislativa/legislativne-procesy/SK/PI/2024/334) is not yet passed and therefore the exact technical details and timelines are not clear.
Most likely, the system will be based on PEPPOL, which pretix is planning to provide an integration for in the future. 
But the system will probably also require real-time reporting to the fiscal authority, which pretix does not support.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Slovakia](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Slovakia).

## pretixPOS

When operating a cash register in Slovakia, the cash register must be compliant with [local regulations](https://www.financnasprava.sk/sk/podnikatelia/dane/ekasa) and interface with the fiscal authority.
pretixPOS does **not** support this and can therefore **not** be used as cash register software in Slovakia.
