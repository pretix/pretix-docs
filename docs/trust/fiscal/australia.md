## Value-added Tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Australia, GST ("Goods and services tax") may apply.
You can configure all Australian VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. cross-border transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Australia currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format.

## pretixPOS

We are not aware of specific requirements on cash registers in Australia.
Therefore, we believe pretixPOS can generally be used in Australia.
