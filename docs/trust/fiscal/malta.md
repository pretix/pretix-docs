## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Malta, VAT ("It-taxxa fuq il-valur mizjud") may apply.
You can configure all Maltese VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Malta currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Malta](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Malta).

## pretixPOS

When operating a cash register in Malta, the cash register must be certified according to [local legislation](https://cfr.gov.mt/en/vat/technical_information/Documents/05.%20GG270407%20Fiscal%20Cash%20Register%20Requirements%20en.pdf).
pretixPOS is **not** certified and can therefore **not** be used as cash register software in Malta.
