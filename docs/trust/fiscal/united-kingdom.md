## Value-added Tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Switzerland, VAT ("Value-added tax") may apply.
You can configure all Swiss VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. cross-border transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

The UK currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format.

## pretixPOS

We are not aware of specific requirements on cash registers in the UK.
Therefore, we believe pretixPOS can generally be used in the UK.
