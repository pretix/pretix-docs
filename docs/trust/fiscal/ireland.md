## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Ireland, VAT ("Value-added tax") may apply.
You can configure all Irish VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Ireland currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Ireland](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Ireland).

## pretixPOS

We are not aware of specific requirements on cash registers in Ireland.
Therefore, we believe pretixPOS can generally be used in Ireland.
