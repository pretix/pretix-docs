## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Estonia, VAT ("KÃ¤ibemaks", "KM") may apply.
You can configure all Estonian VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Estonia is planning to introduce mandatory e-invoicing for transactions between businesses (B2B) in 2027.
The law is not yet passed and therefore the exact technical details and timelines are not clear yet.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Estonia](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Estonia).

## pretixPOS

We are not aware of specific requirements on cash registers in Estonia.
Therefore, we believe pretixPOS can generally be used in Estonia.
