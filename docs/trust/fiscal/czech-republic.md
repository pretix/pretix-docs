## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in the Czech Republic, VAT ("Dan z pridane hodnoty", "DPH") may apply.
You can configure all Czech VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

The Czech Republic currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Czech Republic](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Czech+Republic).

## pretixPOS

The Czech Republic used to have special requirements on cash registers ("EET"), but the law was [abolished](https://financnisprava.gov.cz/en/financial-administration/electronic-records-of-sales) in 2023.
Therefore, we believe pretixPOS can generally be used in the Czech Republic.
