## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Bulgaria, VAT ("Danak varhu dobavenata stoinost", "DDS") may apply.
You can configure all Bulgarian VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Bulgaria currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Bulgaria](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Bulgaria).

## pretixPOS

When operating a cash register in Bulgaria, the cash register must integrate with a fiscal device conforming to [local regulations](https://old.nra.bg/en/document?id=228).
pretixPOS does **not** support this and can therefore **not** be used as cash register software in Bulgaria.
