## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Finland, VAT ("Arvonlisävero", "ALV") may apply.
You can configure all Finnish VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Finland currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format for transactions between businesses (B2B) or businesses and consumers (B2C).

Finland only mandates e-invoices for transactions between businesses and the government (B2G) and allows using the Peppol network.
A native integration of pretix with Peppol is available as a plugin as part of our pretix Hosted product.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Finland](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Finland).

## pretixPOS

We are not aware of specific requirements on cash registers in Finland.
Therefore, we believe pretixPOS can generally be used in Finland.
