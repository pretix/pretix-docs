## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in Greece, VAT ("Foros prostithemenis aksias", "FPA") may apply.
You can configure all Greek VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

Greece currently does not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format for transactions between businesses (B2B) or businesses and consumers (B2C).

Greece only mandates e-invoices for transactions between businesses and the government (B2G) in a way compatible with the PEPPOL network.
pretix is planning to provide a PEPPOL integration.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in Greece](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Greece).

## pretixPOS

When operating a cash register in Greece, the cash register must be compliant with [local regulations](https://www.aade.gr/en/diasyndesipos) and interface with the fiscal authority.
pretix does not support this.
