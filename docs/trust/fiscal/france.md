## Value Added Tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in France, VAT ("TVA") may apply.
All French VAT rates can be configured in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## pretixPOS

Using a cash register in France requires the software to be certified under the [NF525](https://infocert.org/en/nf525/) standard.
pretixPOS is currently not certified under this standard and can therefore not be used as a cash register in France.
