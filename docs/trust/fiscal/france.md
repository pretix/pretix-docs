## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in France, VAT ("taxe sur la valeur ajout√©e", "TVA") may apply.
You can configure all French VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## pretixPOS

Using a cash register in France requires the software to be certified under the [NF525](https://infocert.org/en/nf525/) standard.
pretixPOS is currently **not** certified under this standard and can therefore **not** be used as cash register software in France.
