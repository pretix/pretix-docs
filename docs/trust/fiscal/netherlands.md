## Value-added tax (VAT)

When selling goods and services in The Netherlands, VAT ("omzetbelasting"/"Belasting (over de) toegevoegde waarde", "Btw") may apply.
You can configure all Dutch VAT rates in pretix using [tax rules](../../guides/taxes.md), including more complex tax cases (e.g. intra-EU reverse charge transactions).

## Invoicing

### E-invoicing

The Netherlands currently do not require sending electronic invoices in a structured format for transactions between businesses (B2B) or businesses and consumers (B2C).

The Netherlands only mandate e-invoices for transactions between businesses and the central government (B2G) using the PEPPOL network.
pretix is planning to provide a PEPPOL integration.

More information is available on the website of the European Commission: [eInvoicing in The Netherlands](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+The+Netherlands).

## pretixPOS

We are not aware of specific requirements on cash registers in The Netherlands.
Therefore, we believe pretixPOS can generally be used in The Netherlands.
