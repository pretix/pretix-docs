# Fiscal requirements

If you use pretix to sell any paid goods or services, it is your responsibility to ensure that your usage of pretix is in line with tax law.
Tax law differs significantly from country to country.
If you need information on the interaction of pretix with tax law in any specific country, click the article for that country in the menu on the left. 

You can still use pretix if your country is not included in the list. 
That just means that we have not yet been able to compile information on the specific requirements for that country.
If you need help figuring out how to use pretix in your country, reach out to us at [support@pretix.eu](mailto:support@pretix.eu)
