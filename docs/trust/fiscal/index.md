# Fiscal requirements

When you use pretix to sell tickets, you need to make sure that your usage of pretix is in line with tax law.
Tax law differs significantly from country to country.
Therefore, please select your country in the navigation to receive country-specific information.

If your country is not contained in the list, it does not mean that you cannot use pretix.
Instead, it means that we have not yet been able to compile information on the specific requirements.
Please reach out to us at [support@pretix.eu](mailto:support@pretix.eu) if we can help you figuring out if pretix can be used in your country.
