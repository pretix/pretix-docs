# Small-scale deployment with Docker

This guide describes the installation of a small-scale installation of pretix using docker. By small-scale, we mean that everything is being run on one host and you don't expect thousands of participants trying to get a ticket within a few minutes. In this setup, as many parts of pretix as possible are hidden away in one single docker container. This has some trade-offs in terms of performance and isolation but allows a rather easy installation.

!!! Warning

    Even though we try to make it straightforward to run pretix, it still requires some Linux experience to get it right. If you're not feeling comfortable managing a Linux server, check out our hosting and service offers at [pretix.eu](https://pretix.eu/).

We tested this guide on the Linux distribution **Debian 12** but it should work very similar on other modern distributions, especially on all systemd-based ones.

## Requirements

Please set up the following systems beforehand, we'll not explain them here (but see these links for external installation guides):

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/debian/)
-   A SMTP server to send out mails, e.g. [Postfix](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-postfix-as-a-send-only-smtp-server-on-ubuntu-22-04) on your machine or some third-party server you have credentials for
-   A HTTP reverse proxy, e.g. [nginx](https://botleg.com/stories/https-with-lets-encrypt-and-nginx/) or Apache to allow HTTPS connections
-   A [PostgreSQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-22-04) 12+ database server
-   A [redis](https://blog.programster.org/debian-8-install-redis-server/) server

We also recommend that you use a firewall, although this is not a pretix-specific recommendation. If you're new to Linux and firewalls, we recommend that you start with [ufw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall).

!!! Note

    Please, do not run pretix without HTTPS encryption. You'll handle user data and thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificates can be obtained for free these days. We also *do not* provide support for HTTP-only installations except for evaluation purposes.

!!! Warning

    By default, using [ufw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall) in conjunction with docker will not have any effect. Please make sure to either bind the exposed ports of your docker container explicitly to 127.0.0.1 or configure docker to respect any set up firewall rules.

## On this guide

All code lines prepended with a `#` symbol are commands that you need to execute on your server as `root` user; all lines prepended with a `$` symbol can also be run by an unprivileged user.

## Data files

First of all, you need to create a directory on your server that pretix can use to store data files and make that directory writable to the user that runs pretix inside the docker container:

``` console
# mkdir /var/pretix-data
# chown -R 15371:15371 /var/pretix-data
```

## Database

Next, we need a database and a database user. We can create these with any kind of database managing tool or directly on our database's shell. Please make sure that UTF8 is used as encoding for the best compatibility. You can check this with the following command:

``` console
# sudo -u postgres psql -c 'SHOW SERVER_ENCODING'
```

For PostgreSQL database creation, we would do:

``` console
# sudo -u postgres createuser -P pretix
# sudo -u postgres createdb -O pretix pretix
```

Make sure that your database listens on the network. If PostgreSQL on the same same host as docker, but not inside a docker container, we recommend that you just listen on the Docker interface by changing the following line in `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf`:

``` none
listen_addresses = 'localhost,172.17.0.1'
```

You also need to add a new line to `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf` to allow network connections to this user and database:

``` none
host    pretix          pretix          172.17.0.1/16           md5
```

Restart PostgreSQL after you changed these files:

``` console
# systemctl restart postgresql
```

If you have a firewall running, you should also make sure that port 5432 is reachable from the `172.17.0.1/16` subnet.

## Redis

For caching and messaging in small-scale setups, pretix recommends using redis. In this small-scale setup we assume a redis instance to be running on the same host. To avoid the hassle with network configurations and firewalls, we recommend connecting to redis via a unix socket. To enable redis on unix sockets, add the following to your `/etc/redis/redis.conf`:

``` none
unixsocket /var/run/redis/redis.sock
unixsocketperm 777
```

Now restart redis-server:

``` console
# systemctl restart redis-server
```

In this setup, systemd will delete `/var/run/redis` on every redis restart, which will cause issues with pretix. To prevent this, you can execute:

``` console
# systemctl edit redis-server
```

And insert the following:

``` systemd
[Service]
# Keep the directory around so that pretix.service in docker does not need to be
# restarted when redis is restarted.
RuntimeDirectoryPreserve=yes
```

!!! Warning

    Setting the socket permissions to 777 is a possible security problem. If you have untrusted users on your system or have high security requirements, please don't do this and let redis listen to a TCP socket instead. We recommend the socket approach because the TCP socket in combination with docker's networking can easily become an even worse security hole when configured slightly wrong. Read more about security on the [redis website](https://redis.io/topics/security).

    Another possible solution is to run [redis in docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/redis/) and link the containers using docker's networking features.

## Config file

We now create a config directory and config file for pretix:

``` console
# mkdir /etc/pretix
# touch /etc/pretix/pretix.cfg
# chown -R 15371:15371 /etc/pretix/
# chmod 0700 /etc/pretix/pretix.cfg
```

Fill the configuration file `/etc/pretix/pretix.cfg` with the following content (adjusted to your environment):

``` ini
[pretix]
instance_name=My pretix installation
url=https://pretix.mydomain.com
currency=EUR
; DO NOT change the following value, it has to be set to the location of the
; directory *inside* the docker container
datadir=/data
trust_x_forwarded_for=on
trust_x_forwarded_proto=on

[database]
backend=postgresql
name=pretix
user=pretix
; Replace with the password you chose above
password=*********
; In most docker setups, 172.17.0.1 is the address of the docker host. Adjust
; this to wherever your database is running, e.g. the name of a linked container.
host=172.17.0.1

[mail]
; See config file documentation for more options
from=tickets@yourdomain.com
; This is the default IP address of your docker host in docker's virtual
; network. Make sure postfix listens on this address.
host=172.17.0.1

[redis]
location=unix:///var/run/redis/redis.sock?db=0
; Remove the following line if you are unsure about your redis' security
; to reduce impact if redis gets compromised.
sessions=true

[celery]
backend=redis+socket:///var/run/redis/redis.sock?virtual_host=1
broker=redis+socket:///var/run/redis/redis.sock?virtual_host=2
```

See [Email settings](../config.md#email) to learn more about configuring mail features.

## Docker image and service

First of all, download the latest stable pretix image by running:

``` console
$ docker pull pretix/standalone:stable
```

We recommend starting the docker container using systemd to make sure it runs correctly after a reboot. Create a file named `/etc/systemd/system/pretix.service` with the following content:

``` systemd
[Unit]
Description=pretix
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=0
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill %n
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm %n
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --name %n -p 127.0.0.1:8345:80 \
    -v /var/pretix-data:/data \
    -v /etc/pretix:/etc/pretix \
    -v /var/run/redis:/var/run/redis \
    --sysctl net.core.somaxconn=4096 \
    pretix/standalone:stable all
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop %n

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You can now run the following commands to enable and start the service:

``` console
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl enable pretix
# systemctl start pretix
```

## Cronjob

You need to set up a cronjob that runs the management command `runperiodic`. The exact interval is not important but should be something between every minute and every hour. You could for example configure cron like this:

``` none
15,45 * * * * /usr/bin/docker exec pretix.service pretix cron
```

The cronjob may run as any user that can use the docker daemon.

## SSL

The following snippet is an example on how to configure a nginx proxy for pretix:

``` nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 ipv6only=on default_server;
    server_name pretix.mydomain.com;
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}
server {
    listen 443 ssl default_server;
    listen [::]:443 ipv6only=on ssl default_server;
    server_name pretix.mydomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.chain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8345;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    }
}
```

We recommend reading about setting [strong encryption settings](https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/) for your web server.

## Next steps

Yay, you are done! You should now be able to reach pretix at <https://pretix.yourdomain.com/control/> and log in as *admin@localhost* with a password of *admin*. Don't forget to change that password! Create an organizer first, then create an event and start selling tickets!

You should probably read [Backups and monitoring](../maintenance.md) next.

## Updates

!!! Warning

    While we try hard not to break things, **please perform a backup before every upgrade**.

Updates are fairly simple, but require at least a short downtime:

``` console
# docker pull pretix/standalone:stable
# systemctl restart pretix.service
# docker exec -it pretix.service pretix upgrade
```

Restarting the service can take a few seconds, especially if the update requires changes to the database. Replace `stable` above with a specific version number like `1.0` or with `latest` for the development version, if you want to.

Make sure to also read [Update notes](../updates.md) and the release notes of the version you are updating to. Pay special attention to the "Runtime and server environment" section of all release notes between your current and new version.

## Install a plugin

To install a plugin, you need to build your own docker image. To do so, create a new directory and place a file named `Dockerfile` in it. The Dockerfile could look like this (replace `pretix-passbook` with the plugins of your choice):

``` docker
FROM pretix/standalone:stable
USER root
RUN pip3 install pretix-passbook
USER pretixuser
RUN cd /pretix/src && make production
```

Then, go to that directory and build the image:

``` console
$ docker build . -t mypretix
```

You can now use that image `mypretix` instead of `pretix/standalone` in your service file (see above). Be sure to re-build your custom image after you pulled `pretix/standalone` if you want to perform an update.

## Scaling up

If you need to scale to multiple machines, please first read our [scaling guide](../scaling.md).

If you run the official docker container on multiple machines, it is recommended to set the environment variable `AUTOMIGRATE=skip` on all containers and run `docker exec -it pretix.service pretix migrate` on one machine after each upgrade manually, otherwise multiple containers might try to upgrade the database schema at the same time.

To run only the `pretix-web` component of pretix as well as a nginx server serving static files, you can invoke the container with `docker run … pretix/standalone:stable web` (instead of `all`). You can adjust the number of `gunicorn` processes with the `NUM_WORKERS` environment variable (defaults to two times the number of CPUs detected).

To run only `pretix-worker`, you can run `docker run … pretix/standalone:stable taskworker`. You can also pass arguments to limit the worker to specific queues or to change the number of concurrent task workers, e.g. `docker run … taskworker -Q notifications --concurrency 32`.
