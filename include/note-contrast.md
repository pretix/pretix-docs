!!! Note 

    High contrast is an important factor in your customers' ability to access your shop. 
    They may be viewing your shop on a small device, a subpar screen, in high ambient light, or with visual impairment. 
    Even a design that looks good to you in the public profile preview may not have high enough contrast for those cases. 
    The notes underneath the color input field in the pretix software will help you ensure that the chosen colors have high enough contrast. 
    Please do not ignore the note if it asks you to choose a different shade.
