## How do I delete an event?

You can find the event deletion button at the bottom of the event settings page. Note, however, that it is not possible
to delete an event once any order or invoice has been created, as those likely contain information on financial
transactions which legally may not be tampered with and needs to be kept on record for multiple years in most
countries. In this case, you can just disable the shop by clicking the first square on your event
dashboard.

If you are using the hosted service at pretix.eu and want to get rid of an event that you only used for testing, contact
us at support@pretix.eu and we can remove it for you.
