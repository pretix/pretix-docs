## How to work on the project

On the technical side, this is based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
so view those pages for in-depth details. A number of plugins are installed that add significant functionality, such as
[i18n](https://github.com/ultrabug/mkdocs-static-i18n), [awesome pages](https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin) and
[macros](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
